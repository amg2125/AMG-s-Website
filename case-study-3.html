        <p>This animated short was created for a class called "Intermediate Animation: Motion Graphics and VFX." For the final project of the course, students had
           to individually create a 2-3 minute animated short films using Adobe After Effects. Students could choose whether they wanted their short films to be 
           narrative films or explainer videos, and they were responsible for creating the film from start to finish and implementing the 12 Principles of Animation
           that we learned in class.

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <div id="development">
        <h3>Finding the Inspiration</h3>
        <p>The first step in development was choosing the subject for my animated short. Since I had already created an explainer video for the previous animation course,
            I decided to try my hand at creating a narrative short film. While exploring potential stories to base my film on, I thought about a project I had created for 
            my "2D Character Design" course called "Death of Innocence." It was a pitch for an adaptation of the book "All Quiet on the Western Front" by Erich Maria 
            Remarque, but set in the modern day during the Russo-Ukariainian War. The main character for my version was called Boris Sperkaz, a Ukrainian college student
            who was drafted into the Ukrainian army upon the outbreak of the war. I thought this would be a good story to adapt into an animated short because it was relevant
            and I already had a lot of materials at hand for it, such as character designs and a basic outline of the story.
        </p>
        <p>Once I had settled on the song and video, I began planning out the music video's structure. Since the song had a quiet, almost melancholic beginning, I wanted the video 
            to begin at the end of the team's magical run, with their loss to the UConn Huskies in the Final Four. After showing some still images of the Hurricanes team after the
            loss, the video would flash back to the end of the regular season and show the team's journey to that Final Four game. The video would follow the team round by round,
            ending with the victory that sent them to the Final Four and the celebrations between the players and head coach Jim Larranaga.
        </p>

                <p class="subtitle">Project Materials Folder</p>
            </div>
        <p>The next step was gathering the resources for the music video and putting them together in Premier Pro. I was able to easily find videos and photos of the games and the 
            audio for "Being Alive" and downloaded them all to my computer. I then imported them to Premier Pro and began the process of cutting and putting the video together. This
            was the most time-consuming part of development because of how meticulous it was. I needed to find clips that could summarize the game and animate the lyrics so they faded in
            and out onscreen at certain moments. The most challenging part was getting everything condensed to fit the length of the song, so I had to continually revise the clips by either
            shortening or removing them entirely. This was very challenging, but I was able to put the video together and turn it in on time. Later, I made some additional adjustments such
            as adding more transitions and shortening more clips to get the final version displayed on this site.

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <div id="takeaways">
        <p>I learned a lot about video editing from working on this project. One of the biggest lessons I learned was that video editing requires a lot of cutting, shortening, and deleting
             of footage. I had to make many changes to the footage that I didn't originally plan on, and this was mainly due to having to compress everything to make sure it fit the length 
             of the song. Another big takeaway I took from this was that sometimes projects need another round of work before they look satisfactory. My original cut of the music video was
             good, but there were ways it could be improved. By revisiting the project and making a few more changes, like adding zooming transitions and shortening more clips, I was able to
             create a better version of the video.
