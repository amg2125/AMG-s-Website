            <div id="aboutme"><p>Hi! Iâ€™m Alejandro Galego and I am a student at the University of Miami with a major in Interactive Media and a minor in Game Design. 
                I possess a broad set of skills including illustration, graphic design, writing, character design, and to a lesser degree coding. 
                I am very proficient with digital programs such as Microsoft Office, Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects. 
                I am also incredibly collaborative and get along well with other people, especially in team environments. </p>

            <p>I have always been a creative-driven person, fascinated by storytelling and the impact it can have on the world regardless of its form. 
                I also value hard work as a fundamental key to success. Though I have not yet held a professional position, I have gained invaluable experience 
                both in volunteer work and in my academic projects in college, some of which are displayed on this website. I am constantly trying to improve my 
                abilities and learn new applications for them, and I always try to keep an open mind for where those opportunities lie. Outside of work, I enjoy 
                drawing, writing, watching sports, and walking my dogs.</p>
