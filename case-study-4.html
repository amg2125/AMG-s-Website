    </div>

    <div id="intro">
        <p>This virtual reality experience was created for a course called "Immersive Storytelling". For the project, 
            students had to create a VR experience that both told a story and was interactive. The students that I worked
            with on this project were Daniele Montefiori, Jack Ketchum, and Lejie Lin.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <div id="development">
        <h3>Choosing the Concept</h3>
        <p>I chose to adapt a concept I had developed for a previous course: "Death of Innocence", a modern retelling of "All Quiet on
            the Western Front" set during the Russo-Ukariainian War. The story follows Boris Sperkaz, a Ukrainian college student 
            who is drafted into the army at the outbreak of the war. I already had character designs and a basic outline, making this 
            an ideal starting point.
        </p>
            <div class="master-container">
                <div class="media-container">
                    <img src="images/Case-Study-3/Boris Character Sheet.jpg" alt="Boris Character Design" class="screenshot">
                    <p class="subtitle">Character design for Boris Sperkaz made for a previous course</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">Various sketches of Boris Sperkaz made for a previous course</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        <h3>Script and Storyboard</h3>
        <p>I structured the video as a trailer to fit the project's time limit. I wrote a script in which Boris narrates how his life changed 
            when the war came, and created a storyboard showing scenes from before and during the war. I revised the script and storyboard as the 
            project progressed, adjusting for pacing, visuals, and whatever was realistic to animate in the time I had.
        </p>
            <div class="master-container">

                </div>
            </div>
        <h3>Asset Creation</h3>
        <p>I created all the assets for the film—characters, props, and backgrounds—in Adobe Illustrator. For Boris, I referenced his previous character
            design sketches and created multiple models for different scenes and expressions. Since some models took longer to create than others, I started 
            animating fully completed scenes while continuing to build the remaining assets in others to stay on schedule.
        </p>

                </div>
            </div>
        <h3>Narration and Sound Design</h3>
        <p>While creating the visuals, I also collected multiple sound effects from YouTube and stock sound libraries to fit the various scenes. For the narration,
            I used the AI text-to-speech generator ElevenLabs to voice Boris, since I lacked the time and resources to find a voice actor or record it myself. I 
            copied the script into Elevenlabs and generated the audio clips with a fitting voice, which saved time and kept the film's tone consistent.
        </p>

                </div>
            </div>
        <h3>Animating in After Effects</h3>
        <p>Animation was the most crucial and time-intensive part of the project. I carefully parented and layered all the assets, applied keyframes for movements, 
            and utilized class-taught techniques throughout the process. One complex scene involved multiple Ukrainian soldiers running into battle, and to speed up
            the animation process I used a plugin called Duik Angela to rig the soldiers. This was my first time using Duik and I ran into problems with the rigging,
            but with trial and error, and help from the professor, I made it work.
        </p>
            <div class="master-container">
                <div class="media-container">
                    <img src="images/Case-Study-3/AE Gif 1.gif" alt="Kyiv rocket attack scene" class="gif">
                    <p class="subtitle">Kyiv under attack by rockets</p>
                </div>
                <div class="media-container">
                    <img src="images/Case-Study-3/AE Gif 2.gif" alt="Ukrainian battle charge scene" class="gif">
                    <p class="subtitle">Ukrainian soldiers charge into battle</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        <h3>Editing and Final Delivery</h3>
        <p>After animating, I assembled the short in Adobe Premier Pro. The editing process was straightforward since I only needed to arrange and cut the scenes
            together. After that, I exported the final film and screened it on the final day of class.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Deliverable</h2>

    </div>

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <div id="takeaways">
        <p>This project allowed me to learn more about After Effects and its various plugins. Duik Angela was challenging to use, but learning to use it gave me 
            insight into rigging workflows and shortcuts in After Effects. I also learned that AI tools like Elevenlabs can be useful timesavers, especially for 
            solo projects. Lastly, animating while assets were still in progress got me into an efficient workflow, allowing me to manage my time better and helping
            me meet the deadline.
