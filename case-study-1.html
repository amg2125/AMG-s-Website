    <h1>Final Four Music Video</h1>
    <div id="media-type">
    <h3>Media Type: Music Video</h3>
    </div>

    <div id="intro">
        <p>This project was my first foray into video editing. It was created for an art class called "Intro to Electronic Media", and it was a solo project 
        meant to test our knowledge of Adobe Premier Pro in class. Students were given the freedom to choose whatever song and footage they wanted for the video,
        but they had to include certain video effects and display the lyrics onscreen every few times in the video.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <div id="body">
        <p>The first step in the development of the project was choosing a song and footage to accompany it. At the time I was taking this class, the Miami Hurricanes men's
            basketball team made a historic run through the NCAA men's basketball tournament, climbing all the way up to the Final Four for the first time in the program's
            history. Since I am an avid sports fan and I had followed the Canes basketball team for years, I decided to theme my music video around their Final Four journey.
            For the music, I chose the song "Being Alive" by Barbara Streisand, from the musical "Company." I chose the song because I felt it matched the arc of the team's 
            journey; the song begins slow and quiet and gradually builds until it explodes in an epic crescendo at the end.
        </p>
        <p>Once I had settled on the song and video, I began planning out the music video's structure. Since the song had a quiet, almost melancholic beginning, I wanted the video 
            to begin at the end of the team's magical run, with their loss to the UConn Huskies in the Final Four. After showing some still images of the Hurricanes team after the
            loss, the video would flash back to the end of the regular season and show the team's journey to that Final Four game. The video would follow the team round by round,
            ending with the victory that sent them to the Final Four and the celebrations between the players and head coach Jim Larranaga.
        </p>
        <p>The next step was gathering the resources for the music video and putting them together in Premier Pro. I was able to easily find videos and photos of the games and the 
            audio for "Being Alive" and downloaded them all to my computer. I then imported them to Premier Pro and began the process of cutting and putting the video together. This
            was the most time-consuming part of development because of how meticulous it was. I needed to find clips that could summarize the game and animate the lyrics so they faded in
            and out onscreen at certain moments. The most challenging part was getting everything condensed to fit the length of the song, so I had to continually revise the clips by either
            shortening or removing them entirely. This was very challenging, but I was able to put the video together and turn it in on time. Later, I made some additional adjustments such
            as adding more transitions and shortening more clips to get the final version displayed on this site.

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <div id="takeaways">
        <p>I learned a lot about video editing from working on this project. One of the biggest lessons I learned was that video editing requires a lot of cutting, shortening, and deleting
             of footage. I had to make many changes to the footage that I didn't originally plan on, and this was mainly due to having to compress everything to make sure it fit the length 
             of the song. Another big takeaway I took from this was that sometimes projects need another round of work before they look satisfactory. My original cut of the music video was
             good, but there were ways it could be improved. By revisiting the project and making a few more changes, like adding zooming transitions and shortening more clips, I was able to
             create a better version of the video.
