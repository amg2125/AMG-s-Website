    <div id="intro">
        <p>This animated short was my final project for a course called "Intermediate Animation: Motion Graphics and VFX."
            Each student had to create a 2-3 minute animated short film in Adobe After Effects, either narrative or explainer.
            The film also had to incorporate the 12 Principles of Animation that were taught in class. I chose to create a narrative
            film for this project.

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <div id="development">
        <h3>Choosing the Concept</h3>
        <p>I chose to adapt a concept I had developed for a previous course: "Death of Innocence", a modern retelling of "All Quiet on
            the Western Front" set during the Russo-Ukariainian War. The story follows Boris Sperkaz, a Ukrainian college student 
            who is drafted into the army at the outbreak of the war. I already had character designs and a basic outline, making this 
            an ideal starting point.

                </div>
            </div>
        <h3>Script and Storyboard</h3>
        <p>I structured the video as a trailer to fit the project's time limit. I wrote a script in which Boris narrates how his life changed 
            when the war came, and created a storyboard showing scenes from before and during the war. I revised the script and storyboard as the 
            project progressed, adjusting for pacing, visuals, and whatever was realistic to animate in the time I had.

                </div>
            </div>
        <h3>Asset Creation</h3>
        <p>I created all the assets for the film—characters, props, and backgrounds—in Adobe Illustrator. For Boris, I referenced his previous character
            design sketches and created multiple models for different scenes and expressions. Since some models took longer to create than others, I started 
            animating fully completed scenes while continuing to build the remaining assets in others to stay on schedule.
        </p>

                </div>
            </div>
        <h3>Narration and Sound Effects</h3>
        <p>While I was building the assets in Illustrator, I was also looking for sound effects to add into the film. I needed a lot of sound effects for the all the different
           scenes, and luckily I was able to find and download a lot of sound effects on YouTube and other stock sound effect websites. In addition to the sound effects, I 
           also needed to record Boris's narration for the film. I didn't have time to find someone to do the narration and I felt that reading it myself wouldn't have the
           effect I wanted, so I decided to use an AI text-to-speech program to create the narration. I used a website called ElevenLabs to generate the narration, and I
           simply had to copy and paste the script into the website and select the voice I wanted. After selecting the voice, I generated the audio clips in portions and 
           downloaded the clips to my computer. The task of gathering the sound effects and narration didn't take long, which allowed me to focus more on finishing the
           assets and animating the scenes.

            </div>
        <h3>Animating with After Effects</h3>
        <p>The animation stage of production was the most important and time-consuming part of the project. I had experience animating with After Effects before, having
           done so for a previous class in 2D animation, but it was still a challenge to get everything animated. I had to make sure that all the assets were parented
           and layered correctly, utilize certain animation tools and concepts learned in class, and make sure that everything worked properly. The process of animating
           with After Effects involved moving or rotating the assets and adding keyframes to mark each movement. One of the most challenging scenes to animate was a scene 
           where multiple Ukrainian soldiers are running across a rugged field during an attack. Instead of animating each soldier manually, I used an plugin for After Effects
           called Duik Angela that allowed me to create a puppet rig for each soldier and animate them without using keyframes. I never used Duik before, so I ran into a
           few issues with it early on, mainly with getting the rig to work properly. With some trial and error and help from the professor, I was able to get the rigs working 
           and animate all the soldiers in the scene.

                </div>
            </div>
        <h3>Editing and Finalization</h3>
        <p>After I completed animating all the scenes, the final step was to edit the whole film together in Premier Pro. I imported all the individual scenes into Premier 
           and cut the whole film together. This was the easiest part of the project because I didn't have to do much editing outside of putting the scenes together. With 
           this step completed, I exported the file and presented the completed film to the professor and the class on the last day of the course.

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <div id="takeaways">
        <p>This project was a great opportunity to learn more about animating with After Effects through hands-on experience. In addition to using features and tools I was 
           familiar with, I also got to use new features and plugins that I wasn't familiar with such as Duik Angela. One of the takeaways I took from this experience was 
           that there are many more features, tools, and plugins that I can use to animate with After Effects, and that sometimes all it takes is a little bit of playing 
           around to figure out how to use them. Another major takeaway I took from this project was that After Effects plugins can be just as difficult to use as as After 
           Effects itself. Duik was frustrating to use at times, but I gained a lot of experience from it and learned it can be a powerful tool to save time and effort for 
           animating.
