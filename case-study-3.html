        <p>This animated short was created for a class called "Intermediate Animation: Motion Graphics and VFX." For the final project of the course, students had
           to individually create a 2-3 minute animated short films using Adobe After Effects. Students could choose whether they wanted their short films to be 
           narrative films or explainer videos, and they were responsible for creating the film from start to finish and implementing the 12 Principles of Animation
           that we learned in class.

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <div id="development">
        <h3>Finding the Inspiration</h3>
        <p>The first step in development was choosing the subject for my animated short. Since I had already created an explainer video for the previous animation course,
            I decided to try my hand at creating a narrative short film. While exploring potential stories to base my film on, I thought about a project I had created for 
            my "2D Character Design" course called "Death of Innocence." It was a pitch for an adaptation of the book "All Quiet on the Western Front" by Erich Maria 
            Remarque, but set in the modern day during the Russo-Ukariainian War. The main character for my version was called Boris Sperkaz, a Ukrainian college student
            who was drafted into the Ukrainian army upon the outbreak of the war. I thought this would be a good story to adapt into an animated short because it was relevant
            and I already had a lot of materials at hand for it, such as character designs and a basic outline of the story.
        </p>
        <h3>Script and Storyboard</h3>
        <p>After I had settled on the subject of my animated short, I set out to create a script and storyboard for it. Since I had a limited amount of time to work with for 
           my short, I decided to structure the video as if it was a trailer for a longer film. I wrote a script with Boris narrating how his life changed when the war came,
           and my storyboard consisted of a series of scenes showing Boris's life before and during the war. When planning out the storyboard, I thought carefully about what
           shots I wanted to include, how they would flow into each other, and how to connect the dialogue with the visuals.

                <p class="subtitle">The first page of the storyboard for "Death of Innocence"</p>
            </div>
        <p>After I had the storyboard and script planned out, I started creating all the assets for the video. I used Adobe Illustrator to draw the characters and backgrounds
            for my animated short film, but I used different references for each. For the characters, I used the character designs I had created back in my 2D Character Design 
            class, and for the backgrounds and objects, I used references the Internet.

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <div id="takeaways">
        <p>I learned a lot about video editing from working on this project. One of the biggest lessons I learned was that video editing requires a lot of cutting, shortening, and deleting
             of footage. I had to make many changes to the footage that I didn't originally plan on, and this was mainly due to having to compress everything to make sure it fit the length 
             of the song. Another big takeaway I took from this was that sometimes projects need another round of work before they look satisfactory. My original cut of the music video was
             good, but there were ways it could be improved. By revisiting the project and making a few more changes, like adding zooming transitions and shortening more clips, I was able to
             create a better version of the video.
